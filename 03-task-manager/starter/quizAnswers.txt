Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    - They are used as functions that are envoked before the next function.
    They modify requests and responses.

What does CRUD stand for?
    - Create, Read, Update, and Delete

You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
    - In the env file I create a variable that holds my MongoDB credentials.
    connect.js sets us up to connect to the mongoose database
    app.js reads that connect.js file and then with the variable 'start' reads the info in the
    .env file in order to connect to MongoDB
    

How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
     - I make sure the .env file name is put in the .gitignore file so github doesn't upload that info
